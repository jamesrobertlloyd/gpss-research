@article{Dunson2008,
abstract = {We propose a class of kernel stick-breaking processes for uncountable collections of dependent random probability measures. The process is constructed by first introducing an infinite sequence of random locations. Independent random probability measures and beta-distributed random weights are assigned to each location. Predictor-dependent random probability measures are then constructed by mixing over the locations, with stick-breaking probabilities expressed as a kernel multiplied by the beta weights. Some theoretical properties of the process are described, including a covariate-dependent prediction rule. A retrospective Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is developed for posterior computation, and the methods are illustrated using a simulated example and an epidemiological application.},

Mon- drian processes are multidimensional generalizations of Poisson processes and this connection allows us to construct multidimensional generalizations of the stick- breaking process described by Sethuraman (1994), recovering the Dirichlet pro- cess in one dimension. After introducing the Aldous-Hoover representation for jointly and separately exchangeable arrays, we show how the process can be used as a nonparametric prior distribution in Bayesian models of relational data.},

abstract = {Complex biological, technological, and sociological networks can be of very different sizes and connectivities, making it difficult to compare their structures. Here we present an approach to systematically study similarity in the local structure of networks, based on the significance profile (SP) of small subgraphs in the network compared to randomized networks. We find several superfamilies of previously unrelated networks with very similar SPs. One superfamily, including transcription networks of microorganisms, represents "rate-limited" information-processing networks strongly constrained by the response time of their components. A distinct superfamily includes protein signaling, developmental genetic networks, and neuronal wiring. Additional superfamilies include power grids, protein-structure networks and geometric networks, World Wide Web links and social networks, and word-adjacency networks from different languages.},

These hidden variables can capture effects that cannot be directly measured in a gene expression profiling experiment, for example: genes that have not been included in the microarray, levels of regulatory proteins, the effects of mRNA and protein degradation, etc.},

We propose a latent cluster random effects model to represent all of these features, and we describe a Bayesian estimation method for it. The model is applicable to both binary and non-binary network data. We illustrate the model using two real datasets. We also apply it to two simulated network datasets with the same, highly skewed, degree distribution, but very different network behavior: one unstructured and the other with transitivity and clustering. Models based on degree distributions, such as scale-free, preferential attachment and power-law models, cannot distinguish between these very different situations, but our model does.},

The approach uses nested stick-breaking processes to allow for trees of unbounded width and depth, where data can live at any node and are infinitely exchangeable. One can view our model as providing infinite mixtures where the components have a dependency structure corresponding to an evolutionary diffusion down a tree. By using a stick-breaking approach, we can apply Markov chain Monte Carlo methods based on slice sampling to perform Bayesian inference and simulate from the posterior distribution on trees. We apply our method to hierarchical clustering of images and topic modeling of text data.\}, keywords = \{bayesian nonparametrics, dirichlet process, hierarchical clustering, highlighted, stick-breaking process}},

This distribution is suitable for use as a prior in probabilisticmodels that represent objects using a potentially infinite array of features, or that involve bipartite graphs in which the size of at least one class of nodes is unknown. We give a detailed derivation of this distribution, and illustrate its use as a prior in an infinite latent featuremodel. We then review recent applications of the Indian buffet process in machine learning, discuss its extensions, and summarize its connections to other stochastic processes.},

@article{Vanhatalo2010,
abstract = {Gaussian process (GP) models are widely used in disease mapping as they provide a natural framework for modeling spatial correlations. Their challenges, however, lie in computational burden and memory requirements. In disease mapping models, the other difficulty is inference, which is analytically intractable due to the non-Gaussian observation model. In this paper, we address both these challenges. We show how to efficiently build fully and partially independent conditional (FIC/PIC) sparse approximations for the GP in two-dimensional surface, and how to conduct approximate inference using expectation propagation (EP) algorithm and Laplace approximation (LA). We also propose to combine FIC with a compactly supported covariance function to construct a computationally efficient additive model that can model long and short length-scale spatial correlations simultaneously. The benefit of these approximations is computational. The sparse GPs speed up the computations and reduce the memory requirements. The posterior inference via EP and Laplace approximation is much faster and is practically as accurate as via Markov chain Monte Carlo.},

@article{Ahmed2009,
abstract = {A plausible representation of the relational information among entities in dynamic systems such as a living cell or a social community is a stochastic network that is topologically rewiring and semantically evolving over time. Although there is a rich literature in modeling static or temporally invariant networks, little has been done toward recovering the network structure when the networks are not observable in a dynamic context. In this article, we present a machine learning method called TESLA, which builds on a temporally smoothed l(1)-regularized logistic regression formalism that can be cast as a standard convex-optimization problem and solved efficiently by using generic solvers scalable to large networks. We report promising results on recovering simulated time-varying networks and on reverse engineering the latent sequence of temporally rewiring political and academic social networks from longitudinal data, and the evolving gene networks over >4,000 genes during the life cycle of Drosophila melanogaster from a microarray time course at a resolution limited only by sample frequency.},

Analyzing such data with probabilisic models can be delicate because the simple exchangeability assumptions underlying many boilerplate models no longer hold. In this paper, we describe a latent variable model of such data called the mixed membership stochastic blockmodel. This model extends blockmodels for relational data to ones which capture mixed membership latent relational structure, thus providing an object-specific low-dimensional representation. We develop a general variational inference algorithm for fast approximate posterior inference. We explore applications to social and protein interaction networks.},

abstract = {Mathematical modelling is central to systems and synthetic biology. Using simulations to calculate statistics or to explore parameter space is a common means for analysing these models and can be computationally intensive. However, in many cases, the simulations are easily parallelizable. Graphics processing units (GPUs) are capable of efficiently running highly parallel programs and outperform CPUs in terms of raw computing power. Despite their computational advantages, their adoption by the systems biology community is relatively slow, since differences in hardware architecture between GPUs and CPUs complicate the porting of existing code.},

abstract = {In vivo variations in the concentrations of biomolecular species are inevitable. These variations in turn propagate along networks of chemical reactions and modify the concentrations of still other species, which influence biological activity. Because excessive variations in the amounts of certain active species might hamper cell function, regulation systems have evolved that act to maintain concentrations within tight bounds. We identify simple yet subtle structural attributes that impart concentration robustness to any mass-action network possessing them. We thereby describe a large class of robustness-inducing networks that already embraces two quite different biochemical modules for which concentration robustness has been observed experimentally: the Escherichia coli osmoregulation system EnvZ-OmpR and the glyoxylate bypass control system isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase-phosphatase-isocitrate dehydrogenase. The structural attributes identified here might confer robustness far more broadly.},

abstract = {We present a general approach for collaborative filtering (CF) using spectral regularization to learn linear operators mapping a set of “users” to a set of possibly desired “objects”. In particular, sev- eral recent low-rank type matrix-completion methods for CF are shown to be special cases of our proposed framework. Unlike existing regularization-based CF, our approach can be used to incor- porate additional information such as attributes of the users/objects—a feature currently lacking in existing regularization-based CF approaches—using popular and well-known kernel methods. We provide novel representer theorems that we use to develop new estimation methods. We then provide learning algorithms based on low-rank decompositions and test themon a standard CF data set. The experiments indicate the advantages of generalizing the existing regularization-based CF methods to incorporate related information about users and objects. Finally, we show that certain multi-task learning methods can be also seen as special cases of our proposed approach.},

@article{Alon1999,
abstract = {Networks of interacting proteins orchestrate the responses of living cells to a variety of external stimuli, but how sensitive is the functioning of these protein networks to variations in their biochemical parameters? One possibility is that to achieve appropriate function, the reaction rate constants and enzyme concentrations need to be adjusted in a precise manner, and any deviation from these 'fine-tuned' values ruins the network's performance. An alternative possibility is that key properties of biochemical networks are robust; that is, they are insensitive to the precise values of the biochemical parameters. Here we address this issue in experiments using chemotaxis of Escherichia coli, one of the best-characterized sensory systems. We focus on how response and adaptation to attractant signals vary with systematic changes in the intracellular concentration of the components of the chemotaxis network. We find that some properties, such as steady-state behaviour and adaptation time, show strong variations in response to varying protein concentrations. In contrast, the precision of adaptation is robust and does not vary with the protein concentrations. This is consistent with a recently proposed molecular mechanism for exact adaptation, where robustness is a direct consequence of the network's architecture.},

abstract = {One of the central problems in cognitive science is determining the mental representations that underlie human inferences. Solutions to this problem often rely on the analysis of subjective similarity judgments, on the assumption that recognizing likenesses between people, objects, and events is crucial to everyday inference. One such solution is provided by the additive clustering model, which is widely used to infer the features of a set of stimuli from their similarities, on the assumption that similarity is a weighted linear function of common features. Existing approaches for implementing additive clustering often lack a complete framework for statistical inference, particularly with respect to choosing the number of features. To address these problems, this article develops a fully Bayesian formulation of the additive clustering model, using methods from nonparametric Bayesian statistics to allow the number of features to vary. We use this to explore several approaches to parameter estimation, showing that the nonparametric Bayesian approach provides a straightforward way to obtain estimates of both the number of features and their importance.},

Hybrid images are based on the multiscale processing of images by the human visual system and are motivated by masking studies in visual perception. These images can be used to create compelling displays in which the image appears to change as the viewing distance changes. We show that by taking into account perceptual grouping mechanisms it is possible to build compelling hybrid images with stable percepts at each distance. We show ex- amples in which hybrid images are used to create textures that be- come visible only when seen up-close, to generate facial expres- sions whose interpretation changes with viewing distance, and to visualize changes over time within a single picture.},

Most current approaches focus on deterministic (descriptive) models and are usually restricted to a preset number of people. Moreover, the dynamic aspect is often treated as an addendum to the static model. Taking inspiration from real-life friendship formation patterns, we propose a new generative model of evolving social networks that allows for birth and death of social links and addition of new people. Each person has a distribution over social interaction spheres, which we term ”contexts.” We study the robustness of our model by examining statistical properties of simulated networks relative to well known properties of real social networks. We discuss the shortcomings of this model and problems that arise during learning. Sev- eral extensions are proposed.},

abstract = {Time-evolving networks are a natural representation for dynamic social and biological interactions. While latent space models are gaining popularity in network modeling and analysis, previous works mostly ignore networks with temporal behavior and multi-modal actor roles. Furthermore, prior knowledge, such as division and grouping of social actors or biological specificity of molecular functions, has not been systematically exploited in network modeling. In this paper, we develop a networkmodel featuring a state space mixture prior that tracks complex actor latent role changes through time. We provide a fast variational inference algorithm for learning our model, and validate it with simulations and held-out likelihood comparisons on real-world time-evolving networks. Finally, we demonstrate our model’s utility as a network analysis tool, by applying it to United States Congress voting data.},

abstract = {Complex networks are studied across many fields of science. To uncover their structural design principles, we defined "network motifs," patterns of interconnections occurring in complex networks at numbers that are significantly higher than those in randomized networks. We found such motifs in networks from biochemistry, neurobiology, ecology, and engineering. The motifs shared by ecological food webs were distinct from the motifs shared by the genetic networks of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae or from those found in the World Wide Web. Similar motifs were found in networks that perform information processing, even though they describe elements as different as biomolecules within a cell and synaptic connections between neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans. Motifs may thus define universal classes of networks. This approach may uncover the basic building blocks of most networks.},

abstract = {We propose fLDA, a novel matrix factorization method to predict ratings in recommender system applications where a “bag-of-words” representation for item meta-data is natu- ral. Such scenarios are commonplace in web applications like content recommendation, ad targeting and web search where items are articles, ads and web pages respectively. Because of data sparseness, regularization is key to good predictive accuracy. Our method works by regularizing both user and item factors simultaneously through user features and the bag of words associated with each item. Specifically, each word in an item is associated with a discrete latent factor often referred to as the topic of the word; item topics are obtained by averaging topics across all words in an item. Then, user rating on an item is modeled as user’s affinity to the item’s topics where user affinity to topics (user factors) and topic assignments to words in items (item factors) are learned jointly in a supervised fashion. To avoid overfitting, user and item factors are regularized through Gaussian lin- ear regression and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) priors respectively. We show our model is accurate, interpretable and handles both cold-start and warm-start scenarios seam- lessly through a single model. The efficacy of our method is illustrated on benchmark datasets and a new dataset from Yahoo! Buzz where fLDA provides superior predictive ac- curacy in cold-start scenarios and is comparable to state-of- the-art methods in warm-start scenarios. As a by-product, fLDA also identifies interesting topics that explains user- item interactions. Our method also generalizes a recently proposed technique called supervised LDA (sLDA) to col- laborative filtering applications. While sLDA estimates item topic vectors in a supervised fashion for a single regression, fLDA incorporates multiple regressions (one for each user) in estimating the item factors.},

abstract = {Recently, variational Bayesian (VB) techniques have been applied to probabilistic matrix factorization and shown to perform very well in experiments. In this paper, we theoretically elucidate properties of the VB matrix factorization (VBMF) method. Through finite-sample analysis of the VBMF estimator, we show that two types of shrinkage factors exist in the VBMF estimator: the positive-part James-Stein (PJS) shrinkage and the trace-norm shrinkage, both acting on each sin- gular component separately for producing low-rank solutions. The trace-norm shrinkage is simply induced by non-flat prior information, similarly to the maximum a posteriori (MAP) approach. Thus, no trace-norm shrinkage remains when priors are non-informative. On the other hand, we show a counter-intuitive fact that the PJS shrinkage factor is kept activated even with flat priors. This is shown to be induced by the non-identifiability of the matrix factorization model, that is, the mapping between the target matrix and factorized matrices is not one-to-one. We call this model-induced regularization. We further extend our analysis to empirical Bayes scenarios where hyperparameters are also learned based on the VB free energy. Throughout the paper, we assume no missing entry in the observed matrix, and therefore collaborative filtering is out of scope.},

abstract = {Algorithms for finding structure in data have become increasingly important both as tools for scientific data analysis and as models of human learning, yet they suffer from a critical limitation. Scientists discover qualitatively new forms of structure in observed data: For instance, Linnaeus recognized the hierarchical organization of biological species, and Mendeleev recognized the periodic structure of the chemical elements. Analogous insights play a pivotal role in cognitive development: Children discover that object category labels can be organized into hierarchies, friendship networks are organized into cliques, and comparative relations (e.g., "bigger than" or "better than") respect a transitive order. Standard algorithms, however, can only learn structures of a single form that must be specified in advance: For instance, algorithms for hierarchical clustering create tree structures, whereas algorithms for dimensionality-reduction create low-dimensional spaces. Here, we present a computational model that learns structures of many different forms and that discovers which form is best for a given dataset. The model makes probabilistic inferences over a space of graph grammars representing trees, linear orders, multidimensional spaces, rings, dominance hierarchies, cliques, and other forms and successfully discovers the underlying structure of a variety of physical, biological, and social domains. Our approach brings structure learning methods closer to human abilities and may lead to a deeper computational understanding of cognitive development.},

@article{Ratmann2007a,
abstract = {Gene duplication with subsequent interaction divergence is one of the primary driving forces in the evolution of genetic systems. Yet little is known about the precise mechanisms and the role of duplication divergence in the evolution of protein networks from the prokaryote and eukaryote domains. We developed a novel, model-based approach for Bayesian inference on biological network data that centres on approximate Bayesian computation, or likelihood-free inference. Instead of computing the intractable likelihood of the protein network topology, our method summarizes key features of the network and, based on these, uses a MCMC algorithm to approximate the posterior distribution of the model parameters. This allowed us to reliably fit a flexible mixture model that captures hallmarks of evolution by gene duplication and subfunctionalization to protein interaction network data of Helicobacter pylori and Plasmodium falciparum. The 80\% credible intervals for the duplication-divergence component are [0.64, 0.98] for H. pylori and [0.87, 0.99] for P. falciparum. The remaining parameter estimates are not inconsistent with sequence data. An extensive sensitivity analysis showed that incompleteness of PIN data does not largely affect the analysis of models of protein network evolution, and that the degree sequence alone barely captures the evolutionary footprints of protein networks relative to other statistics. Our likelihood-free inference approach enables a fully Bayesian analysis of a complex and highly stochastic system that is otherwise intractable at present. Modelling the evolutionary history of PIN data, it transpires that only the simultaneous analysis of several global aspects of protein networks enables credible and consistent inference to be made from available datasets. Our results indicate that gene duplication has played a larger part in the network evolution of the eukaryote than in the prokaryote, and suggests that single gene duplications with immediate divergence alone may explain more than 60\% of biological network data in both domains.},
